As Ralf Krümmel, I'm thrilled to announce a significant step in my experimental AI project, M.Y.R.A.! I've successfully compiled desktop versions for Windows and Linux, and I'm eager to share them for testing with the broader community.

M.Y.R.A. stands for a simulated cognitive architecture designed to push beyond the limitations of reactive Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages an LLM (such as Google Gemini) as a "language center" within a much broader, dynamic system of nodes dedicated to emotion, metacognition, and self-regulation. This approach offers a glimpse into the future of AI.

Key features include:
*   **Observable Internal State Model:** Gain insights into its cognitive processes.
*   **MUSE-AI:** A multi-perspective deep analysis capability.
*   **Integrated AGI-Level Assessment Tool:** Evaluate its capabilities.
*   **Bilingual (DE/EN) Support:** Interact in German or English.

This project is a deep dive into how we can move beyond the current paradigms of LLMs, exploring pathways towards more sophisticated AI systems.

Ready to explore M.Y.R.A.? Your feedback and discussions are highly valued!
